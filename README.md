# What is a Sender Score?

Your Sender Score is like a credit score to gauge your credit worthiness but for email: It measures the health of your email program. Sender Score is a number between 0 and 100 identifying the quality of your sender reputation and details how mailbox providers view your IP address.

Mailbox providers take a lot of metrics into consideration to determine your sender reputation including spam complaints, how many unknown users you email, if youâ€™re on any industry blacklists, and more.
